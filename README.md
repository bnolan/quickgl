## Limitations

- RGB565
- 480x480

## Configuring on MacOS

    brew install sdl2 clang-format cmake opencv
    cd third_party/quickjs && make
    cd third_party/tinygl && make
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..

## Build and run

    make && ./QuickGL

## Configuring for Web

    Install [emscripten](https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html)

## Coding standard

1. Run clang-format
2. Keep it simple
3. Don't use exceptions

And best efforts:

1. Don't crash
2. Don't leak
